=============================================
Welcome to makeraxis's documentation Wiki!
=============================================

This wiki is a work in progress and will contain user as well as developer documentation for all our products. We don't differentiate between developer and user. Most of products are aligned with education and research community, they are all developers. 

We try to keep it up to date. But if you come across any errors please let us know at support@hoverirds.in. We will try our best to resolve it. 
Alternatively you can fix it yourself in Github repo, we will happily merge your pull requests.

Nexus: Autonomous Robotics Research Platform
==============================================
We love putting Raspberry Pi in our robots. It adds incredible value to the platforms with very little hardware cost. We have whipped up a small set up of software components that we use for all our platforms. Most components are anyway opensource. We decided to opensource our little bit of glue here and there as well. We call the resulting platform Nexus.

Our first product is `RW460 <http://store.makeraxis.in/product/rw460-foldable-quadcopter/>`__ copter. this will soon be followed by and FW800 plane, RD200 Rover and B300 boat.
